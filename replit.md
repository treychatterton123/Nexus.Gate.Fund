# Nexus Gate Fund Trading Bot

## Overview

This is an automated trading bot application that combines market data analysis, AI-powered decision making, and real-time portfolio tracking. The system fetches market data for major indices (SPY, QQQ, VIXY, etc.), uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to analyze market signals, and logs all trading decisions to Google Sheets for record-keeping.

## System Architecture

The application follows a Flask-based web architecture with the following key characteristics:

- **Backend Framework**: Flask with Python 3.11
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server on autoscale infrastructure
- **Database**: No traditional database; uses Google Sheets as data persistence layer
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for trading decision analysis
- **Market Data**: Finnhub API for real-time market data
- **Authentication**: Google Cloud Service Account for Sheets API access

## Key Components

### 1. Flask Web Application (`app.py`)
- Main web interface for monitoring trading bot status
- Dashboard displaying latest market signals, trading decisions, and history
- RESTful API endpoints for market data retrieval
- Real-time status monitoring of bot operations

### 2. Trading Bot Engine (`main.py`)
- Core trading logic with scheduled market data fetching
- OpenAI integration for AI-powered trading decisions
- Google Sheets integration for logging and persistence
- Portfolio tracking with position management
- Supports multiple trading instruments (SPY, QQQ, DIA, VIXY, etc.)

### 3. Market Data Processing
- Real-time data fetching from Finnhub API every 5 minutes
- Market signal analysis and technical indicator calculations
- Caching mechanism to optimize API usage
- Error handling for API failures and network issues

### 4. Portfolio Management
- Virtual portfolio starting with $10,000 cash
- Position tracking for multiple instruments
- Average price calculation for holdings
- Real-time portfolio valuation
